# religion-project
This is a Project I developed for a religion class at BYU as well as for personal use. 

***It is written in NodeJs using EJS as well as CSS and Javascript functionalities.  
Utilizes packages such as knex for database connection to Postgres***

What the webapp does is display a table (from an existing database) that has some of my favorite scriptures from the Book of Mormon.

You are able to add new scriptures as well as edit or delete current and existing ones.

This is a work in progress and I hope to add more features.  One already implemented is a filter on the "Location" button that queries and displays scriptures based
on what book they are found in.




Side Note: A lot of this project was for me to test out my CSS skills more as well as dive deeper into NodeJS usage and application.  Very much a SELF TEST.
